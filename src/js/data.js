Peach, Champagne, Bronze and Gold Interchangeable Beaded Watch Band","description":"WATCH FACE SOLD SEPARATELY!! This band is shown pictured with the SMALL ROUND BLING face in GOLD. Please visit my shop to purchase a face to go with this band.\r\n\r\n**Buy 4 bands, get a 5th FREE!! DO NOT PURCHASE THE 5TH FREE BAND, but let me know in the notes to seller which band you would like free.**\r\n\r\nThis listing is for ONE watch band. This band is available in SM, MED, LG, or XL\r\n\r\n@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*\r\nThis gorgeous, chunky watch band features peach, bronze and champagne colored acrylic, resin and pearl beads mixed with warm gold plated accents.  It is strung on durable stretch cord and is finished off with 4 gold plated lobster clasps.\r\n@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*@*\r\n\r\nSIZING: Our watch bands come in Small= 4.5&quot;, Medium= 5&quot;, Large= 5.5&quot; and XLarge= 6&quot;. If you need a larger band (6.5&quot; or more), please contact us about the possibility of making you a larger band. There will be additional cost involved for the extra materials.\r\n\r\nThe watch faces range in length from 1.25&quot;-2&quot;. The watch bands are not measured from end to end, but rather by circumference (inside measurement) to adjust for chunkier beads (i.e. a chunky band will actually be longer end-to-end than a non-chunky band). Add the size of the watch face to the length of the band and you will get the finished watch size. To choose the perfect watch band size for you, take your wrist measurement and add 1\/2&quot; if you like a snug fit, or 1&quot; if you like a loose fit. Then, subtract the length of the face, and you will be left with the band size that you need.\r\n\r\nEX: If you have a 6&quot; wrist, and prefer a snug fit (6.5&quot;), you would choose a small (4 .5&quot;) band and a 1.875&quot; or 2&quot; face, or a medium (5&quot;) band and a 1.5&quot; or 1.75&quot; face. Make sense?? \r\n\r\nIf you are unsure what size watch band you need, please convo us with your wrist measurement, whether you want a snug or loose fit, and the name of the watch face you would like (or have already), and we will let you know what size band you will need.","creation_tsz":1466702607,"ending_tsz":1477243407,"original_creation_tsz":1381349176,"last_modified_tsz":1466702607,"price":"20.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["watch","beaded","interchangeable","stretch","double strand","beaded watch band","bracelet watch","glass pearls","peach","champagne","bronze","gold plated","whiskey"],"category_path":["Jewelry","Bracelet","Beaded"],"category_path_ids":[68887482,68888548,69161269],"materials":["acrylic","silver plated beads","lobsters","powercord","resin flowers","glass pearls"],"shop_section_id":5900150,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1466537428,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/165281327\/fields-of-gold-peach-champagne-bronze?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":416,"num_favorers":34,"shipping_template_id":14588204,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":2,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2016","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":null,"is_private":false,"recipient":"women","occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"suggested_taxonomy_id":1193,"taxonomy_path":["Jewelry","Bracelets"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":701042646,"hex_code":"B99E81","red":185,"green":158,"blue":129,"hue":31,"saturation":30,"brightness":72,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1418952600,"listing_id":165281327,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/056\/0\/5315436\/il_75x75.701042646_scdk.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/056\/0\/5315436\/il_170x135.701042646_scdk.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/056\/0\/5315436\/il_570xN.701042646_scdk.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/056\/0\/5315436\/il_fullxfull.701042646_scdk.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1000},{"listing_image_id":511075310,"hex_code":"A2856E","red":162,"green":133,"blue":110,"hue":27,"saturation":32,"brightness":63,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1381349176,"listing_id":165281327,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/5315436\/il_75x75.511075310_jmxa.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/5315436\/il_170x135.511075310_jmxa.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/5315436\/il_570xN.511075310_jmxa.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/5315436\/il_fullxfull.511075310_jmxa.jpg","full_height":675,"full_width":1000},{"listing_image_id":701165585,"hex_code":"BA9E7F","red":186,"green":158,"blue":127,"hue":32,"saturation":31,"brightness":72,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1418952600,"listing_id":165281327,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/053\/0\/5315436\/il_75x75.701165585_ttb0.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/053\/0\/5315436\/il_170x135.701165585_ttb0.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/053\/0\/5315436\/il_570xN.701165585_ttb0.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/053\/0\/5315436\/il_fullxfull.701165585_ttb0.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1000}],"Shop":{"shop_id":5315436,"shop_name":"WhichWatchDesigns","user_id":5928585,"creation_tsz":1213914128,"title":"Which watch will you wear today?","announcement":"**ALL BANDS & FACES ARE SOLD SEPARATELY!**\n\nCheck out our bead de-stash shop for great deals on all sorts of beads: 1two3beads.etsy.com\n\nSee my sister&#39;s gorgeous hand-stamped jewelry here: petitepieces.etsy.com","currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":"We will be on vacation until February 18th, 2015.

We suggest learning more if you have specific questions. Here are some helpful tips we found online (this is just a general summary of information and not meant to be complete):\r\n\r\n\u2022 As the barrels are a wood product, they are subject to the wood drying and shrinking.\r\n\u2022 In order for the spigot to flow freely, please remember to remove the bung\/cork before you open the spigot ... pour from the spigot ... then close the spigot and finally ... replace the bung\/cork. \r\n\u2022 To keep your barrels performing and looking their best, please keep them stored in a protected area away from the elements and optimally in a cool and relatively humid area. \r\n\u2022 Barrels with painted black steel hoops are particularly susceptible to moisture. A little care goes a long way. Prevent excessive staining and rust by keeping the exterior of the barrel dry.\r\n\u2022 Avoid water stains by using a funnel to carefully fill your new barrel. \r\n\u2022 Sandpaper will generally remove any stains or marks on the barrel. \r\n\u2022 As the barrels are handcrafted, liquid volume is approximate. \r\n\u2022 You should be able to reuse your barrel from 3-5 times ... remember that each aging will take longer than the previous one. \r\n\u2022 Please do not nail or put screws into the hoops or staves as doing so will compromise the oak and might cause damage. \r\n\u2022 If you want to age a different type of spirit then was initially aged in it, we recommend you use a new barrel. \r\n\u2022 For your safety, if using chemicals to clean\/sanitize your barrels, please follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for proper use.\r\n\u2022 The spirit can age anywhere from one week to one-year, but it&#39;s recommended that you take a small taste test every two weeks.  Remember to only take a small taste to ensure the top of the barrel does not get dry to avoid leaking and losing your spirit to the &#39;Angel&#39;s Share.&#39;  Once the spirit reaches your perfect taste, empty the spirit into a decanter and restart the process!\r\n\r\nAngel\u2019s Share.\r\nAngel\u2019s Share is a fancy name for evaporation. Since mini-barrel staves are thinner than normal distillery size 53-gallon barrel staves, there is a higher \u201cangel\u2019s share\u201d, thus higher evaporation. To avoid this evaporation, make sure you follow the instructions and 1) fill the barrel to the very top when first filling the barrel with your spirit; and 2) keep the top of the barrel moist after using the barrel by rolling the liquid around every couple of days. As previously mentioned, we recommend taking very small taste-tests every two weeks to ensure much of the top of the barrel does not become dry.&quot;\r\n\r\nStoring your Empty Barrel After Initial Use \r\nIdeally, your barrel would always be filled. Used barrels require no special preparation beyond a simple water rinse, if desired, when transferring out and in immediately. If used barrels are to be stored empty, rinse them several times with clean water, and drain thoroughly. Remove the spigot and bung to promote air flow and store out of sunlight and in a cool (55\u00b0 \u2013 60\u00b0) and optimally humid (65% - 75%) area. \r\n\r\nAn alternative is to fill and store barrels with a sulfur-citric holding solution (recipes are online). This holding solution promotes sanitation and keeps the barrels swelled and smelling sweet however ... it will strip some of the oaks flavors. For your safety and the safety of your family, always follow manufacturers\u2019 guidelines and instructions for the proper use of chemicals. \r\n\r\n","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1446905693,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":true,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/SummitEngravingLtd?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/033\/0\/9052662\/iusb_760x100.14372376_mdth.jpg","num_favorers":951,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/130\/0\/9052662\/isla_fullxfull.19916459_jsp3bgzk.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":false,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":false,"has_unstructured_policies":true}},{"listing_id":265393506,"state":"active","user_id":61729553,"category_id":68892062,"title":"Whiskey Label Customizable Text Wedding 200, 375 & 750ML Bottle Stickers Personalized Cold Feet Serum Label gift for Groom","description":"These unique labels are totally customizable.\n\nAt the checkout (Note to Seller) provide us the necessary information such as:\n\n\n1-Bride and Groom&#39;s names\n2-Date and Place\n3-Your phone number \n\n\nQuantity: 1 piece.

The largest forests are in Kyrgyzstan, where trees occur in extensive, nearly pure walnut forests at 1,000\u20132,000 m altitude.
